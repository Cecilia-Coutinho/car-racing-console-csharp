<h2>🌍 Overview</h2>

<p align = center>
The Car Racing Console Simulator is designed to run races with multiple cars over a set distance while trancking the time spent by each car to complete the distance. The system includes random events that may occur during the race to add excitement and unpredictability. Each car runs on its own thread to allow efficient processing of the distance traveled. The simulation is console-based only and does not include graphics.

<h2>📋 MVP</h2>
<p>
The Minimum Viable Product(MVP) of the Car Racing Console Simulator includes the following features:

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>🎯 Simulation of a race with multiple cars.</li>
<li>🎯 Simulation of random events that may occur during the race.</li>
<li>🎯 Implementation of logic for each car to run on its own thread.</li>
<li>🎯 Tracking of the time spent by each car and identification of the winner.</li>
<li>🎯 Printing of status updates in console when a car experiences a problem or reaches the finish line.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These features serve as a solid foundation for a functional console-based car racing simulation.
